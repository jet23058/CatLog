# Documentation Rules

1. **Post-Task Requirement**: 
   - Every time you modify code or complete a task, you MUST check if `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md` need updates.
   
2. **CHANGELOG format**:
   - Append a new entry under the "Unreleased" or current date section.
   - Format: `- [Type] Description of change (File modified)`
   - Type examples: Feat, Fix, Refactor, Docs.

3. **README updates**:
   - If the code changes affect installation, usage, or features described in `README.md`, update the relevant section immediately.
   - Do not ask for permission; treat this as part of the coding task.
